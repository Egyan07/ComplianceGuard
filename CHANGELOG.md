## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Password validation deduplication** — Extracted shared `validate_password_strength()` helper in `auth.py`; removes duplicated 10-line validation block from both `register` and `reset_password` endpoints
- **timezone.utc in compliance health** — `compliance_health_check()` now uses `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` consistently with the rest of the backend; eliminates naive datetime in the one place it was missed
- **execSync → async** — All `execSync` calls in `electron/system/windows.js` replaced with `promisify(exec)`; evidence collection no longer blocks the Electron main thread during collection

### Added
- **test_compliance_service.py** — 49 unit tests covering `ComplianceService` evaluate logic, scoring, status determination, compliance level, recommendations, risk assessment, next review date, trend, and report export
- **test_auth_helpers.py** — 29 unit tests covering `validate_password_strength`, register edge cases, email verification flow, and full forgot/reset password cycle
- **test_models.py** — 22 unit tests covering `EvidenceCollection`, `EvidenceItem`, `ComplianceEvaluationRecord`, and `ControlAssessmentRecord` model creation, defaults, JSON fields, and cascade deletes

### Changed
- **e2e tests wired into CI** — `tests/e2e/` now runs in the `backend-tests` CI job via `--run-e2e` flag
- **UpgradePrompt.test.tsx** — 14 tests covering rendering (open/closed), feature name display, button interactions, onGoToSettings callback, and missing prop safety
- **EvidenceUpload.test.tsx** — 22 tests covering rendering, upload mode toggle, validation, field interactions, file picker in electron mode, and file auto-fill behaviour
- **EvaluationHistory.test.tsx** — 8 tests covering free tier upgrade prompt, onNavigate callback, electron mode, and no-crash rendering
- Total test count: **142 backend + 119 frontend unit + 5 frontend e2e = 266 tests**

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Email verification** — Registration generates a verification token; `/verify-email` endpoint validates it; `/verification-status` checks current state
- **Password reset flow** — `/forgot-password` generates a 1-hour reset token; `/reset-password` validates token, expiry, and password complexity; returns 200 on nonexistent email to prevent user enumeration
- **Playwright e2e tests** — 5 tests covering login page rendering, tab switching, invalid login error display, tagline, and logo; `npm run test:e2e` script
- **Alembic migration** — New migration for `is_verified`, `verification_token`, `reset_token`, `reset_token_expires` on users table

### Fixed
- **datetime deprecation** — Replaced all `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` across backend (auth, evidence collector, AWS integration); eliminates Python 3.12 deprecation warnings

### Changed
- Total test count: **34 backend + 37 frontend + 5 e2e = 76 tests**

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Password complexity enforcement** — Register endpoint validates min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character per app config
- **Rate limiting** — Login capped at 5 req/min, register at 3 req/min per IP via slowapi; auto-disabled in test environment
- **Compliance evaluation persistence** — New `ComplianceEvaluationRecord` and `ControlAssessmentRecord` models; evaluate and history endpoints now read/write to DB instead of in-memory dict
- **Nginx reverse proxy** — `nginx.conf` with security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, XSS), rate limiting zone, and SSL-ready config; uncommented in docker-compose
- **LoginPage tests** — 6 Vitest tests covering form rendering, tab switching, error display, and tagline
- **Weak password test** — Integration test verifying short/simple passwords are rejected
- **Alembic evaluation migration** — Auto-generated migration for compliance_evaluations and control_assessments tables

### Changed
- App startup runs `alembic upgrade head` instead of `Base.metadata.create_all` (fallback for tests without alembic.ini)
- Compliance evaluate and history endpoints now require JWT auth
- App version bumped to `2.1.0` in FastAPI metadata
- Total test count: **29 backend + 37 frontend = 66 tests**

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **AuthContext** — React context managing JWT token, user state, login/register/logout across the app

- **Evidence list endpoints** — New `/evidence/items` and `/evidence/collections` endpoints with pagination
- **Alembic migrations** — Initialized with auto-generated initial migration covering all 5 tables (users, companies, compliance_frameworks, evidence_collections, evidence_items)
- **API integration tests** — 14 tests covering full auth flow, evidence CRUD, compliance endpoints, and health checks
- **Shared auth dependency** — `deps.py` with `get_current_user` using real JWT verification + DB user lookup

### Fixed

- **Frontend Dockerfile** — Updated to Node 20 to match CI
- **conftest.py** — Removed duplicate `pytest_configure` and `pytest_collection_modifyitems`
- **Auth API tests** — Rewrote with proper `dependency_overrides` and in-memory SQLite instead of broken mocks
- **bcrypt compatibility** — Pinned `bcrypt==4.0.1` to fix `passlib` AttributeError on CI

### Changed
- Backend CI now runs both unit tests and integration tests
- Evidence summary endpoint returns real aggregated data from user's collections
- Health endpoint returns real timestamp and version `2.0.0`
- CORS origins include `localhost:3000` for Docker mode

### Changed
- Compliance engine constructor now accepts optional `licenseManager` parameter
